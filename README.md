# 2019A-COMPX301-External-Sort-Merge
This program creates a sorted set of words from a plain text file using a heap and a reoccuring 2 way sort merge.

MakeRuns takes two inputs: the size of heap to be used and the text file to be sorted. It outputs two files in the working directory
SortMerge takes the run size as input and merges the contents of the file out1 and out2 produced by MakeRuns
